examples from introductory C# class 2014

This course is loosely based on [Rob Miles Yellow Book.](http://www.robmiles.com/c-yellow-book/). 
I added nUnit in TDDApplication. To introduce nUnit I did an hst calculating method in CanadianTax.cs with a test in TaxTest.cs.
I also took up Hashtable, delegates, and Abstraction in class, generating the rest of the files ending in test.

The AddingMachine example is pretty much straight from the book.
